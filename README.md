# __AIN420 Project - Litter Detection__
__<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/ae-aydin/litter-detection">Demo</a>__

__Datasets Used:__ <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5829156">PlastOPol</a> & <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3587843">TACO</a>. These two datasets were prepared and combined by using the scripts in the *utils* folder, and then used for training *YOLOv8n*, *YOLOv8s*, and *YOLOv8m* models. Here is the link to the prepared <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1szvMerJx4vxVhYZexYrc7XKUYn3iKIsG/view?usp=sharing">dataset</a>. Weights can be found in the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/ae-aydin/litter-detection/tree/main">Hugging Face repository</a>.

__Datasets Benefited:__ <a href="https://www.seanoe.org/data/00743/85472/">The BeachLitter Dataset v2022</a> & <a href="https://www.seanoe.org/data/00811/92297/">BePLi Dataset v1</a>. These two datasets are tested for training but not included in the final dataset.

For each model, a different *.ipynb* was file used to demonstrate their training processes and performance metrics.
